Vertex AI Pipelines, which supports both Kubeflow Pipelines, or KFP, and TensorFlow Extended, or TFX

ML PIPELINE:

An ML pipeline contains a series of processes and runs in two different environments.


ReLu:
You can use the rectified linear unit (or ReLU) function, which turns an input value to zero if it’s negative, or keeps the original value if it’s positive. 0, infy
the sigmoid function, which turns the input to a value between 0 and 1.  
hyperbolic tangent (Tanh) function, which shifts the sigmoid curve and generates a value between -1 and +1.

softmax is used for multi-class classification, whereas 
sigmoid is used for binary-class classification in logistic regression models.

regression problems, mean squared error, or MSE, is a common one used in linear regression models.
classification problems, cross-entropy is typically used to measure the difference between the predicted and actual probability distributions in logistic regression models.
